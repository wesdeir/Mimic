# TODO List - Future Features & Anti-Cheat Innovations

## Immediate TODOs (v3.6)

### 1. **Create an install wizard. Getting friends to test it out is proving to be a hassle without an installer - difficult for non-techincal users to setup currently. **

### 2. **Auto-Tuning Wizard**
```python
# Based on differential analysis
Features:
  - Analyze training data
  - Suggest Config parameter adjustments
  - "Auto-tune to match [butterfly/jitter/normal]"
  - Preview changes before applying
  - Save custom profiles
```

### **3. Machine Learning Pattern Obfuscation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```python
# Defeat ML-based anti-cheat
Features:
  - Multi-modal distributions (not just Gaussian)
  - Non-stationary patterns (change over time)
  - Hidden Markov Models for state transitions
  - Adversarial noise injection
  
Advanced Implementation:
  - Train GAN on real human click data
  - Generate synthetic delays that fool classifiers
  - Periodically switch between "personas"
  - Use your training data as generator input
```


### **N. A/B Testing Framework**
```python
# Test different configurations
Features:
  - Run multiple configs in rotation
  - Compare detection risk scores
  - Statistical significance testing
  - Auto-select best performer
  
Example:
  Config A: Standard variance
  Config B: +20% variance
  Config C: Custom rhythm
  → Run 100 clicks each → Select winner
```

### **O. Heatmap Visualization**
```python
# 2D heatmap of click delays
X-axis: Click sequence number
Y-axis: Delay (ms)
Color: Frequency

Shows:
  - Pattern clusters
  - Anomalies
  - Drift over time
  - Burst events
```

## Ultimate Anti-Cheat Hardening

### **P. Multi-Layer Randomization**
```python
# Stack multiple RNG sources
Layers:
  1. Hardware RNG (os.urandom)
  2. Time-based seed (microseconds)
  3. User mouse movement seed
  4. Environmental noise (CPU temp, network latency)
  
Why: Makes pattern prediction impossible
```

### **Q. Plausible Deniability Metrics**
```python
# Track "human-ness" score in real-time
Metrics:
  - Matches human training data: +10 points
  - Too consistent: -20 points
  - Natural outliers: +5 points
  - Suspicious patterns: -30 points
  
Goal: Score > 70/100 = "probably human"
```

## Research Ideas

### **S. Study Real Anti-Cheat Systems**
- Decompile Hypixel Watchdog (if legal)
- Analyze ban patterns on forums
- Reverse-engineer detection thresholds
- Crowdsource "ban stories" for data

### **T. Quantum Randomness**
- Use quantum RNG APIs (random.org)
- True randomness vs pseudo-randomness
- Performance vs security trade-off

v4.0 (Future):
- [ ] Machine Learning integration
- [ ] GAN-based click generation
- [ ] Multi-mode detection (PvP/Mining/Building)
- [ ] Environmental reactivity
- [ ] Advanced heatmaps
- [ ] A/B testing framework
```
